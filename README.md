# shopping-list-project

The application is a simple implementation of a shared shopping list built using deno, docker, and PostgreSQL. The application uses a three-tier 
architecture (client, server, and database) and a layered architecture with 4 layers (views, database, controllers, and services). The 
user can perform basic actions with the shopping list: adding new list, deactivating a list, add an item to a list, and mark an item as 
collected. 

It is recommended for the user to register for a ElephantSQL database and use its credentials for the .env file

You can run the application by either using:
- docker-compose up \
or by accessing the folder that contains app.js and use:
- deno run --allow-all --unstable heroku-deploy.js
